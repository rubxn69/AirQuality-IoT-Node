🌫️ ESP32 Air Quality Monitoring Node
This project is an ESP32-based Air Quality Monitoring Node that continuously tracks environmental conditions using:

SDS011 – Laser-based PM2.5 and PM10 dust sensor

DHT11 – Temperature and Humidity sensor

Sensor readings are collected in real-time and uploaded to ThingSpeak for cloud-based data logging and visualization.

🔧 Features
Real-time monitoring of PM2.5, PM10, Temperature, and Humidity

Wireless data upload to ThingSpeak via Wi-Fi

Lightweight and low-power solution for indoor/outdoor deployment

Clean and modular Arduino codebase

📡 Applications
Indoor air quality monitoring

Smart home automation

Environmental research projects

IoT & cloud integration demos
